A program that recursively traverses a directory tree, with the directory being passed as 
an argument. The output will be the number of files checked, the number of directories opened, 
as well as "serials" for each file, which includes the full pathname, ID of device containing file,
permissions, user ID of owner, group ID, size, time of last change, time of last change on the inode table,
and finally, a 32-character long md5sum.
